## Projects

### Beginner Projects

Here are some of the beginner projects solved:

- **[task tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)**: Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks.
- **[github user activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)**: In this project, I built a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal.
- **[unit converter](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter)**: In this project I built a simple web app that can convert between different units of measurement. It can convert units of length, weight. The user can input a value and select the units to convert from and to. The application will then display the converted value.
